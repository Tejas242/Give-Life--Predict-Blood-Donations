# Blood Donation Forecasting Project

"Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person â€” the gift of life." ~ World Health Organization

Forecasting blood supply is a critical and recurring challenge for blood collection managers. According to a report in January 2019, the Red Cross saw 27,000 fewer blood donations over the holidays than they usually receive throughout the year. Machine learning can play a significant role in predicting future blood donations, potentially saving more lives.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a blood donor will donate within a specific time window. The project encompasses the entire model-building process, from data inspection to the application of the TPOT library to automate the machine learning pipeline.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains valuable information regarding blood donors. It includes features such as donation frequency, recency, and other relevant variables that can help in building an accurate predictive model.

### Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TPOT
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- Data Inspection: Exploring and understanding the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and analyzing data patterns.
- Model Building: Utilizing the TPOT library for automated machine learning pipeline creation.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and fine-tuning.
- Conclusion: Summarizing findings and potential use cases.
